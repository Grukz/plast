`plast` is a command-line and heavily modular *threat hunting tool*. It comes with several modules that allow to process multiple data formats, trigger automatic actions upon detection and produce customized output.

`plast` 's engine uses `yara` ({uri-yara}) under the hood, leveraged through `multiprocessing` tasks to perform rule-based detection on multiple types of input.

The main goal of the `plast` project is to provide an *efficient and effortless* way to detect indicators of compromise (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indicator_of_compromise) during incident-response operations.

It provides a comprehensive framework that easily allows to add functionalities to the tool in just a few lines of code, without worrying about efficiency and scalability. `plast` embeds all referenced modules in one single tool, allowing it to be used on the field as a *standalone utility*.

`plast` is entirely written in `python3` which makes it compatible with almost all GNU/Linux and macOS distributions. Nevertheless, some minimal dependencies are required.

== Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on a live system.

=== Prerequisites

Follow the steps described below to install the project on your system.

==== Package Manager (`apt`)

Install the required package(s):

[source,sh]
----
apt install -y make
----

And the latest `python3` environment:

[source,sh]
----
apt install -y python3 python3-pip
----

If you plan on building a developpement environment, you may also need to install the following package:

[source,sh]
----
apt install -y python3-venv
----

Modules have their own dependencies that may not be listed here.

Also, if you plan on compiling hash-based `yara` rules, you will need to install the `openssl` library:

[source,sh]
----
apt install -y libssl-dev
----

=== Installation

Installing `plast` as a system-wide utility is as simple as:

[source,sh]
----
make install
----

It might be necessary to `chmod u+x Makefile` to be able to execute the `make` command.

To install a basic developpement environment, issue the following commands:

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
git clone {uri-repo}.git plast
cd plast
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r REQUIREMENTS
----

== Usage

=== Manual

Use the following command to display the main help menu:

[source,sh]
----
plast --help
----

Each `Pre` module also has a custom help menu that can be called like this (e.g. with the `file` module):

[source,sh]
----
plast file --help
----

=== Basic examples

The following command will recursively look for every file in the `case` directory, process them and pass into every registered `Callback` and `Post` module:

[source,sh]
----
plast -o out file -i case
----

You can easily choose which modules will be invoked during processing by setting the `--callbacks` and `--post` arguments accordingly:

[source,sh]
----
plast -o out --callbacks pineapple kiwi --post banana apple orange file -i case
----

`Callback` and `Post` modules are designed by their basename without extension (e.g. `banana` for `banana.py`).
